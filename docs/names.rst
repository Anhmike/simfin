Column Names
============

These are the column-names and their Python shortcuts used in the SimFin datasets.
You will typically import them in either one of these ways:

.. code-block:: python

    # Import only a few names.
    from simfin.names import TICKER, NET_INCOME, SHARES_BASIC

    # Import all names if you don't know which ones you might need.
    from simfin.names import *

See `Tutorial 01`_ for detailed examples on how to use them.

.. automodule:: simfin.names
