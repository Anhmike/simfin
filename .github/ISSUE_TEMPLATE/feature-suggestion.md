# Feature Suggestion

If you want to suggest a new feature for this project, then please open an issue and discuss it prior to making a pull request. It is possible that the work is already in progress, or that there are certain problems you need to take into account.


## Description

Please describe your idea here and explain why it would be useful.


## Code

The SimFin project has a very small number of developers and we probably do not have the time to implement your idea, so please try and implement a solution yourself and write the code here.

Please ensure that your code is of very high quality, well-documented, well-tested, and in the same polished style as the rest of this project.

Note that if you tab-indent your code-block when writing it here, then it will be formatted properly.


## Example

Please write a working example of how to use your proposed code here, along with the output that is generated. If your example is very long, then you can make a [GitHub Gist](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-gists) and post the link here.
