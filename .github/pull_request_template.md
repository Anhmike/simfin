# Pull Requests

If you want to make contributions to this project, then please open an
issue on GitHub and discuss them prior to opening a pull request. It is
possible that the work is already in progress, or that there are certain
problems you need to take into account.

Before opening a pull request, please post a link to a GitHub gist with a
Python Notebook that includes your proposed code along with a working
example, and an explanation why that feature is useful.

Please ensure that your code is of very high quality, well-documented,
well-tested, and in the same polished style as the rest of this project.
Otherwise we may reject the pull request.
